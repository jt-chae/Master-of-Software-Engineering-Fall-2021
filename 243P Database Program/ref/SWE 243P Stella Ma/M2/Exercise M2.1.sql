-- 8  Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns fro1n the Vendors table: vendor_11ame, vendor_contact_last_naine, and vendor_contact_first_naine.
-- Then, run this statement to make sure it works correctly.
-- Add an ORDER BY clause to this state1nent that sorts the result set by last name and then first name, both in ascending sequence. Then, run this state-
-- ment again to make sure it works correctly. This is a good way to build and test a statement, one clause at a time.
SELECT vendor_name,vendor_contact_last_name,vendor_contact_first_name
FROM Vendors
ORDER BY vendor_contact_last_name,vendor_contact_first_name;

-- 9 Write a SELECT statement that returns one column from the Vendors table
-- named full_name that joins the vendor_contact_last_name and vendor contact first name columns. 
-- For1nat this column with the last name, a co1nma, a space, and the first 11arne like this:
-- Doe, John
-- Sort the result set by last name and then first name in ascending sequence.
-- Return only the contacts whose last name begins with the letter A, B, C, or E. This should retrieve 41 rows.
SELECT CONCAT(vendor_contact_last_name,', ',vendor_contact_first_name)

-- 10 Write a SELECT statement that returns these column names and data from the Invoices table:
-- Due Date Invoice Total
-- 10%
-- Plus lOo/o
-- The invoice due date column The invoice total colu1nn
-- lOo/oofthevalueofinvoice total The value of invoice_total plus 10%
-- Return only the rows with an invoice total that's greater than or equal to 500 and less than or equal to 1000. This should retrieve 12 rows.
-- Sort the result set in descending sequence by invoice_due_date.
SELECT invoice_due_date AS "Due Date",
		invoice_total AS "Invoice Total", 
        0.1*invoice_total AS '10%',
        1.1*invoice_total AS 'Plus 10%'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total>=500 and invoice_total<=1000
ORDER BY invoice_due_date DESC;

-- 11 Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Invoices
-- Use the LIMIT clause so the result set contains only the rows with the 5 largest balances.
SELECT  invoice_number, 
		invoice_total, 
        payment_total+credit_total AS payment_credit_total, 
        invoice_total-payment_total-credit_total AS balance_due
FROM Invoices
WHERE invoice_total-payment_total-credit_total > 50
ORDER BY invoice_total-payment_total-credit_total DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 12 Return only the rows where the payment_date column contains a null value. This should retrieve 11 rows.
SELECT invoice_number,invoice_date,invoice_total-payment_total-credit_total AS balance_due,payment_date
FROM Invoices
WHERE payment_date IS NULL;

-- 13 Write a SELECT statement without a FROM clause that uses the
-- c Â·URRENT DATE function to return the current date in its default format.
-- Use the DATE FORMAT function to format the current date in this format:
-- nun-dd-yyyy
-- This displays the month, day, and four-digit year of the current date.
-- Give this column an alias of current_date. To do that, you must enclose the alias in quotes since that name is already used by the CURRENT_DATE function .
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%m-%d-%Y') AS "current_date";

-- 14 
-- Write a SELECT statement without a FROM clause that creates a row with these columns:
-- starting_principal interest principal_plus_interest
-- Starting principal of $50,000 6.5% of the principal
-- The principal plus the interest
-- To calculate the third column, add the expressions you used for the first two columns.
SELECT 50000 AS starting_principal, 0.065* 50000 AS interest, 1.065*50000 AS principal_plus_interest
