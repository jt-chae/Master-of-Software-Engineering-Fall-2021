-- Chapter 3, Exercise 8
-- Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns from the Vendors table:
-- vendor_name, vendor_contact_last_name, and vendor_contact_first_name.
-- Add an ORDER BY clause to this state1nent that sorts the result set by last
-- name and then first name, both in ascending sequence. 

USE app;

SELECT vendor_name, vendor_contact_last_name, vendor_contact_first_name
FROM vendors
ORDER BY vendor_contact_last_name,vendor_contact_first_name ASC;

-- Chapter 3, Exercise 9
-- Write a SELECT statement that returns one column from the Vendors table
-- named full_name that joins the vendor_contact_last_name and
-- vendor- contact- first- name columns. ForMat this column with the last name, a co1nma, a space, and the first 11arne
-- like this:
-- Doe, John
-- Sort the result set by last name and then first name in ascending sequence.
-- Return only the contacts whose last name begins with the letter A, B, C, or
-- E. This should retrieve 41 rows.
SELECT CONCAT(vendor_contact_last_name,', ',vendor_contact_first_name)
FROM vendors
WHERE (vendor_contact_last_name >= 'E' and vendor_contact_last_name <'F')
OR (vendor_contact_last_name < 'D')
ORDER BY vendor_contact_last_name,vendor_contact_first_name;
-- Chapter 3, Exercise 10
-- Write a SELECT statement that returns these column names and data from
-- the Invoices table:
-- Due Date: The invoice due date column
-- Invoice Total: The invoice total colu1nn
-- 10%: lO% of the value of invoice total
-- Plus lO%: The value of invoice_total plus 10%
-- Return only the rows with an invoice total that's greater than or equal to 500
-- and less than or equal to 1000. This should retrieve 12 rows. Sort the result set in descending 
-- sequence by invoice_due_date.
SELECT invoice_due_date AS 'Due Date',
		invoice_total AS 'Invoice Total', 
        invoice_total*0.1 AS '10%',
        (invoice_total + invoice_total*0.1) AS 'Plus 10%'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total >= 500 and invoice_total <= 1000
ORDER BY invoice_due_date DESC;
-- Chapter 3, Exercise 11
-- Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Invoices table:
-- invoice_number			The invoice_number column
-- invoice_total			The invoice_total column
-- payment_credit_total		Sum of the payment_total and credit_total columns
-- balance_due				The invoice total column minus the payment_total and credit_total columns
SELECT  invoice_number AS 'invoice_number', 
		invoice_total AS 'invoice_total', 
        (payment_total + credit_total) AS 'payment_credit_total', 
        (invoice_total - (payment_total + credit_total)) AS 'balance_due'
FROM invoices
-- Return only invoices that have a balance due that's greater than $50.
-- Sort the result set by balance due in descending sequence.
-- Use the LIMIT clause so the result set contains only the rows with the 5 largest balances.
WHERE (invoice_total - (payment_total + credit_total)) > 50
ORDER BY invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- Chapter 3, Exercise 12
-- Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Invoices table:
-- invoice_number			The invoice_number column
-- invoice_date				The invoice date column
-- balance_due				The invoice_tota] column minus the payment_total and credit total columns
-- payment_date				The payment_date column
-- Return only the rows where the payment_date column contains a null value.
-- This should retrieve 11 rows.
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, (invoice_total-payment_total - credit_total) AS balance_due, payment_date
FROM invoices
WHERE payment_date IS NULL;
-- Chapter 3, Exercise 13
-- Write a SELECT statement without a FROM clause that uses the CURRENT_DATE function to return the 
-- current date in its default format. Use the DATE_FORMAT function to format the current date in this 
-- format: mm-dd-yyyy
-- This displays the month, day, and four-digit year of the current date.
-- Give this column an alias of current_date. To do that, you must enclose the alias in quotes since 
-- that name is already used by the CURRENT_DATE function.

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%m-%d-%Y') AS 'current_date';

-- Chapter 3, Exercise 14
-- Write a SELECT statement without a FROM clause that creates a row with these columns: 
-- starting_principal			Starting principal of $50,000
-- interest						6.5% of the principal
-- principal_plus_interest		The principal plus the interest
-- To calculate the third column, add the expressions you used fo1Â· the first two columns.
SELECT 50000 AS 'starting_principal', 
	0.065* 50000 AS 'interest', 
    0.065* 50000 + 50000 AS 'principal_plus_interest';
