Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. All byte stream classes are 
descended from InputStream and OutputStream.
There are many byte stream classes. To demonstrate how byte streams work, we'll focus on the file 
I/O byte streams, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Other kinds of byte streams are used in much
the same way; they differ mainly in the way they are constructed.
